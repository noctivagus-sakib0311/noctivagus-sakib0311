### Hey, Iâ€™m Sakib ðŸ‘‹

A curious learner from Bangladesh â€”figuring things out as I go. &#x20;

Curious about science, but Iâ€™ve been drawn into the world of code lately. &#x20;

Currently learning Python and working through the Harvard CS50 Python course. &#x20;

&#x20;

just documenting my progress in silence. &#x20;

&#x20;This space helps me keep track of what Iâ€™m learning, building, and planning to do next.Â  One step at a time. ðŸŒ™Â
